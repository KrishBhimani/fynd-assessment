BE6IHqolebzmGA4dbKvoyQ,"So, my husband and I went to to Bombero's for happy hour. Neither of us consider ourselves wine afficianados, but we know what we like. I told the server, Tim, that I wanted a heavy red, and he delivered. It was a wonderful malbec that had deep fruity flavor and a nice hint of vanilla. It went very well with the chocolate dessert that my husband and I shared. 
In the reviews, I see that many people complain about the bread and the bruscetta. I have to say that it was wonderful to have a bread wi",5,5,"The review is highly positive, praising the food, ambiance, and service without mentioning any issues or complaints, indicating an excellent experience deserving of a 5-star rating.",True,
ya-lhmeLlwHjx5dezJaMyg,"I was craving some sweets today and told my husband about this place. Apparently, one needs to make an appointment but my husband made one right away when he called.

qaNZyCUJA6Yp0mvPBCknPQ,"Why did I wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot!  Having a father who grew up on Los Olivos I remained a loyal customer, that is, until last evening's change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of Los Sombreros Authentic Mexican Cafe & Cantina.  I am not an expert on ""authentic"" Mexican cuisine nor will I pretend to know what  the flavors of San Miguel de Allende taste like; however, I am a foodie so I know good food when I eat it.  

We chose to sit outdoor and enj",5,5,"The review is highly positive, praising the food, drinks, service, and atmosphere. The reviewer expresses enthusiasm and gratitude, indicating an excellent experience.",True,

Their hot sandwiches, though greasy, aren't TOO greasy and actually taste like food. The coffee is pretty good, and they have more ways to tart it up than Starbucks does. QT frickin' rocks.

We finished half the of the plates because they give you a lot. It would be better of the price wasn't as pricey. But overall, awesome service and yummy food! We will be back!!
