I've never ever had a bad meal. In fact, I always have a hard time deciding. Some highlights in my opinion are the huevos rancheros, eggs Benedict (with a choice of meat), waffles & the Mexican omelet. 

I never liked Bloody Marys until I had one at Taylor's! I tried a friend's once and have been hooked ever since!
